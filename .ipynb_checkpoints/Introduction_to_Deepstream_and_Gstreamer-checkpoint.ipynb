    "# Overview of the DeepStream SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepStream SDK consists of a set of building blocks which bridge the gap between low level APIs (such as TensorRT, Video Codec SDK) and the user application that takes streaming data input from USB/CSI camera, video from file or streams over RTSP, and uses computer vision to generate insights from pixels for better understanding of the environment. DeepStream SDK can be the foundation layer for a number of video analytic solutions like understanding traffic and pedestrians in smart city, health and safety monitoring in hospitals, self-checkout and analytics in retail, detecting component defects at a manufacturing facility and etc. By utilizing the DeepStream SDK, you can accelerate development of the IVA applications by focusing on building core deep learning models instead of designing end-to-end applications from scratch. DeepStream supports application development in C/C++ and in Python through the Python bindings. DeepStream builds on top of several NVIDIA libraries from the CUDA-X stack such as `CUDA`, `TensorRT`, `NVIDIA® Triton™ Inference server` and `multimedia libraries`. For more details visit [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_Overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/deepstream_overview.png\" height=\"600px\" width=\"700px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the DeepStream SDK extends these capabilities by providing several other hardware accelerated building blocks. This includes support for `TensorRT 8` and `CUDA 11`. In addition, DeepStream applications can be deployed as a part of a larger multi-GPU cluster or a microservice in containers. This allows highly flexible system architectures and opens new application capabilities. The DeepStream Python application uses the `Gst-Python` API action to construct the pipeline and use the `Probe` functions to access data at various points in the pipeline. To read more about developing with python, see [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_Overview.html). Note that DeepStream 6.0.1 may require custom Python binding wheel that target Python 3.8 and Ubuntu 20.04 to be build. [Click here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_python_apps/tree/master/bindings) to see procedures on how to build the custom Python binding wheel. \n",

    "\n",
    "Below, you can see a shortened list of new capabilities provided by DeepStream:\n",
    "- Allowing addition and removal of video stream dynamically and during the pipeline execution,in addition to frame rate and resolution adjustments\n",
    "- Extending the video processing capabilities by supporting custom layers, and user-defined parsing of detector outputs\n",
    "- Providing Support for 360-degree camera using GPU-accelerated dewarping libraries\n",
    "- Augmenting the meta-data with application-specific, user-defined insights\n",

    "# GStreamer Foundations :\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepStream SDK is based on the open source [GStreamer multimedia framework](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/). There are a few key concepts in GStreamer that we need to\n",
    "touch on before getting started. These include Pipelines,Elements, Pads, Buffers, and Caps. We will be\n",
    "describing them at a high level, but encourage those who are interested in the details to read the\n",
    "[GStreamer Basics](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/?gi-language=c) documentation to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements \n",
    "\n",
    "Elements are the core building block with which we make pipelines. Every process in-between the source (i.e. input of the pipeline, e.g. camera and video files) and sink elements (e.g. screen display) is passed through elements. Video decoding and encoding, neural network inference, and displaying text on top of video streams are examples of \"element\". DeepStream allows us to instantiate elements and weave them into pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline \n",
    "\n",
    "All elements in GStreamer must typically be contained inside a pipeline before they can be used, because it takes care of some clocking and messaging functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pipeline is a particular type of bin, which is the element used to contain other elements. Therefore all methods which apply to bins also apply to pipelines. We need to add the elements to the pipeline and are then linked ,this linking must be established following the data flow (this is, from source elements to sink elements). \n",
    "\n",
    "![pipeline](images/pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pads\n",
    "\n",
    "Pads are the interfaces between elements. When data flows from element to another element in a pipeline, it flows from the sink pad of one element to the source pad of another. Note that each element might have zero, one or many source/sink elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![pads](images/pads.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caps\n",
    "\n",
    "Caps (or Capabilities), are the data types that a pad is permitted to utilize or emit. Because pads\n",
    "can allow multiple data types, sometimes the data flow is ambiguous. Pads are \"negotiated\" in\n",
    "order to explicitly define the type of data that can flow through the pad. Caps streamline this\n",
    "process and allow elements of our pipeline with ambiguous pads to negotiate the correct data flow\n",
    "process. Later in this course, we will use caps to pass certain video data types (NV12, RGB) to the\n",
    "downstream elements in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "Buffers carry the data that will passed on through the pipeline. Buffers are timestamped, contain\n",
    "metadata such as how many elements are using it, flags, and pointers to objects in memory. When\n",
    "we write application code, we rely on accessing data attached to the buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plugin based Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepStream applications can be thought of as pipelines consisting of individual components\n",
    "(plugins). Each plugin represents a functional block like inference using TensorRT or multi-stream\n",
    "decode. Where applicable, plugins are accelerated using the underlying hardware to deliver\n",
    "maximum performance. DeepStream’s key value is in making deep learning for video easily\n",
    "accessible, to allow you to concentrate on quickly building and customizing efficient and scalable\n",
    "video analytics applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plugin architecture provides functionality such as video encode/decode, scaling, inferencing, and more. By connecting plugins into a pipeline, we can build complex applications. Because DeepStream is built on top of GStreamer, we can inspect plugins using `gst-inspect-1.0`.\n"
